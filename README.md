## :fire: Introduction
This repository contains the official implementation of **Progressive Prompt Tuning with CLIP(PPTCLIP)**, a novel three-stage method for fine-tuning CLIP to assess the quality of the AIGC images. 

The code is based on the paper: **Progressive Prompt Tuning with CLIP for Semantic and Perceptual AIGC Image Quality Assessment**.

## 🌈 Visual Results
Here are several visual results of the comparison between our method and the ground truth MOS:
