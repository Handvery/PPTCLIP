This repository contains the official implementation of **Progressive Prompt Tuning with CLIP(PPTCLIP)**, a novel three-stage method for fine-tuning CLIP to assess the quality of the AIGC images. AMFT reframes SFT and RL as complementary reward signals and learns an optimal training curriculum to maximize long-term task performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning, and vision-language navigation benchmarks.

The code is based on the paper: [Progressive Prompt Tuning with CLIP for Semantic and Perceptual AIGC Image Quality Assessment].
